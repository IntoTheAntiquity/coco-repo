# In today tyra learned

Visual studio code does not like to recoginze changes made to the specific 
README.md without refreshing the the page. Fun. Why no idea but everything seems to be working. 

In efforts to try and create a bash script to automate updates i found out there is a command to ignore commits called ".gitignore" thats cool.

# UPDATE 

You gotta save it. Like literally go into files and save your changes it 
not recognize it by itself. This maye apply to other machines but i know 
it applies to Tyrajr.

# Order of oeprations 

you gotta "git clone <insertrepository>"
you gotta stage with "git add <insertchanges>" and or "git add . " for all chanegs
you gotta commit to the git with "git commit" it also yells at you when you dont add a comment so "git commit -m "stop yelling""
you gotta push the changes to github with "git push" alternitively " git push origin main " still gotta figure out branches.

oh and "git status" is how to check if it works
